### ⚙️ How It Works

- The platform is simple to use - you only need the TikTok username of the target profile.  
- All accounts generated via bulk systems are automatically integrated into the platform.  
- The system uses a large number of pre-created accounts from automated generation software to improve coverage and efficiency.
